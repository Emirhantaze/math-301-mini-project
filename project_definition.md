## Math 301 Project Definition
# 1)
Write a code (in MATLAB or Python or Java) that simulates drawing of N cards (one-by-one) from a deck of cards which include integers between 1 and 10 (we have a total of 10 cards in the deck). The code should allow you to run several times, show the histogram (PMF) of this discrete random variable (RV), and indicate the expected value and the variance of that RV simultaneously on the screen for each run. Create a table that indicates the expected value and the variance with respect to the changing values of N.
# 2)
Modify the model in the first part to simulate the sum of 4 such integers between 1 and 10. Now your random variable is that sum, and run the simulation N times. Show the histogram (PMF) of X, and indicate the expected value, standard deviation, and the variance of X on the screen. Create a table that indicates these values with respect to the changing values of N.
# 3)
Take a coin with P(tails) = p. Flip the coin N times and let X be the random variable that indicates how many times the coin comes up tails. Now simulate this RV for different p’s and N’s, and report the expected value and the variance of X in a table.
# 4)
Simulate the number of people entering a shop in one hour in Kayseri Park (let random variable X be the number of people). Simulate this RV for different lambdas (average number of people), and report the expected value and the variance of X in a table.
# 5)
Choose one built-in dataset in MATLAB, plot the histogram and fit a probability density function (pdf) to it. Compute the  of a random value being less than a predetermined threshold of your choice.  
# Submission:
A PDF document that includes your codes, execution results, and plots. Also include your observations and interpretation of the results. The deadline is May 10, 2020 11:59pm.
